Chicago ClearStreets - OSM to Fusion Tables

more info at http://derekeder.com/clearstreets/about.html

overview
ClearStreets is built with several different scripts. They work in the following order:
1. Plow Tracker site is scraped and data is saved locally
2. Point data is converted in to GPX format
3. GPX data is 'snapped to grid' for city streets and converted to OSM (Open Street Maps)
4. *this codebase* OSM data is converted in to KML and uploaded to Google Fusion Tables
5. Fusion Table data is read by a front end site and shown on a map (http://derekeder.com/clearstreets/)

purpose
converts a set of OSM (Open Street Map) files to KML and inserts them to Google Fusion Tables

features
osm_to_ft.php - runs continuously and checks the osm folder for updates and processes them based on a datestamp
osm_to_csv.php - does a bulk conversion for all files in the osm folder and writes them to a CSV. this CSV is then manually uploaded in to Fusion Tables

usage
1. copy source/connectioninfo.php.example to source/connectioninfo.php
2. fill in your Google account info in source/connectioninfo.php
3. $ php osm_to_csv.php
