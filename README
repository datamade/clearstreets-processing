overview
ClearStreets is built with several different scripts. They work in the following order:
1. Plow Tracker site is scraped and data is saved locally
2. Point data is converted in to GPX format
3. *this codebase* GPX data is 'snapped to grid' for city streets and converted to OSM (Open Street Maps)
4. OSM data is converted in to KML and uploaded to Google Fusion Tables
5. Fusion Table data is read by a front end site and shown on a map (http://derekeder.com/clearstreets/)
